## Overview

The Password Strength Checker with GUI is a Python program that evaluates the strength of passwords based on various criteria such as length, character complexity, and the presence of common patterns or dictionary words. This program provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, allowing users to check the strength of their passwords conveniently.

## Features

- **Password Strength Evaluation**: The program checks the strength of passwords based on multiple criteria, including length, uppercase and lowercase characters, numeric characters, special characters, and avoidance of common patterns or dictionary words.

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: The program includes a user-friendly GUI built with Tkinter, providing an interactive and intuitive way for users to input their passwords and view the strength evaluation results.

- **Instant Feedback**: Once the user clicks the "Check" button, the program immediately displays a message box with the password's strength evaluation, providing instant feedback and guidance.

- **Minimum Length Requirement**: The program enforces a minimum password length of 8 characters, ensuring that passwords meet a basic security standard.

- **Common Pattern Detection**: The program detects common patterns or dictionary words within passwords, alerting users if their passwords contain such patterns that may reduce security.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x (Python 3.9 recommended)
- Tkinter (included in standard Python library)
